# Canonical Failure Modes of AI-Generated Software

This document defines the core failure modes that occur
disproportionately in AI-generated or AI-assisted codebases.

These failure modes are structural and semantic, not language-specific,
and are not reliably detected by traditional static or dynamic analysis.

Each failure mode is implemented as one or more detection rules.
