    description: >
      Hallucinated Safety represents trust failures where safety constructs
      appear to exist but do not enforce failure semantics.

    severity_tiers:
      critical:
        base_penalty: 20
        description: >
          Safety construct is entirely ineffective in a critical execution path.
      high:
        base_penalty: 12
        description: >
          Safety construct exists but does not alter control flow.
      medium:
        base_penalty: 6
        description: >
          Partial enforcement with unsafe fallback behavior.
      low:
        base_penalty: 2
        description: >
          Cosmetic or superficial safety construct with limited impact.
